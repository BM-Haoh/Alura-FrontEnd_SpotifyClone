# Alura-FrontEnd_SpotifyClone
Project made in Alura's classes; Learning about HTML, CSS, JavaScript and React.

## React-Version:
- I didn't change anything in the App.test.js, index.css, index.js, reportWebVitals.js or setupTests.js files, just in the App.js and App.cs. The Footer, Main-container, Sidebar, api-artists and assets are just the "React form" of the HTML version.

obs: This project was written in Portuguese, although the comments are in English.
